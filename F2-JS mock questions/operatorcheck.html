        <p> let x = 3; <br>
            let y = new Number(3) ;<br>
            let z = 3;<br>
            console.log(x == y); // => true <br>
            console.log(x === y); // => fase <br>

        <p>
            The first comparison x == y returns true because the == operator checks for equality of values, not types.
            In this case, the value of x (which is 3) is equal to the value of y (which is also 3). However, x is a
            primitive number type while y is an object of the Number type.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second comparison x === y returns false because the === operator checks for equality of values and
            types. In this case, x is a primitive number type and y is an object of the Number type, so they are not the
            same type.
        </p>

        <p>
            The third comparison y === z returns false because the === operator checks for equality of values and types.
            In this case, y is an object of the Number type and z is a primitive number type, so they are not the same
            type.
